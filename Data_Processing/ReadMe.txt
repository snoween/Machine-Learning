Data processing is the task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired form. 
It means making the data more meaningful and informative
-> Output of this complete process can be in any desired forn like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images, etc. Depending on the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine.
The process will be: Collection -> Preparation -> Input -> Processing -> Output Storage

1. Collection:
- Data can be collected from authenticated source like data.gov.in, Kaggle or UCI dataset repository
-> Reason: high-quality and accurate data will make the learning process of the model easier and better and at the time of testing, the model would yield state-of-the-art results
- We need to decide what kind of data we need to execute our tasks or research

2. Preparation:
- The collected data can be in a raw form which cannot be directly fed to the machine
-> We need to collect datasets from different sources, analyzing these datasets and then constructing a nnew dataset for further processing and exploration
- This preparation can be performed either manually or from the automatic approach
- Note that data can also be prepared in numeric forms also which would fasten the model's learning
For instance: convert an RGB inmage to a matrix of NxN dimensions to calculate and work with

3. Input:
- Now the prepared data can be in the form thay may not be machine-readable 
-> To convert this data to readable form, we need to use some conversation algorithms
- For this task to be executed, high computation and accuracy is needed
Example: Data can also be collected through the sources like MNIST Digit data (images), Twitter comments, audio files, video clips

4. Processing:
- This is the stage where algorithms and ML techniques are required to perform the instructions provided over a large volume of data with accuracy and optimal computation (or can say building a training model for short)

5. Output:
- In this stage, results are procured by the machine in a meaningful manner which can be inferred easily by the user
- Output can be in the form of reports, graphs, videos, etc.

6. Storage:
- The final step to obtained output and the data model data and all the useful information are saved for future use
