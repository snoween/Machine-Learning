Linear Regression Model (Only use when the data has linear relationship)
============================================
To build a linear regression model, it is quite easy with some several steps. This one is my summary after I took a course "Machine Learning With Python" by IBM

First of all, we have various mathods to train and test the dataset. But after doing self-learning, I realize that to avoid out of sample accuracy (the model will not accurate if we use the data out of dataset), we should split the dataset into 2 parts.
1. Split the dataset:
-In my program, I will use randomly 80% of dataset for training and 20% for testing. 

2. Building linear regression model:
2.1) For training set:
-We will choose one column if we want to build simple linear regression model and several columns from Training dataset in case multiple linear regression
-If we use the scikitlearn library, it is not hard to do the next step: we will train the model by using scikit learn to get the coefficient(s) and intercept value

I recommend you to understand some maths to understand how our model works.
As we know, each data in the input column is label as Xi, the predicted value is labeled as y_hat. The formula is:

y_hat = (theta zero) + (theta one).Xi

theta zero: intercept
theta one: coefficient (usually will be displayed as a matrix)

We need to find the values of both coefficients and intercept. So how to do that?
a) To find theta one:
theta one = sum((Xi - mean(X)).(Yi - mean(Y)) / sum([Xi - mean(X)]**2)

mean(X) = sum(Xi)/n of that column
mean(Y) = sum(Yi)/n of that column

b) To find theta zero:

theta zero = mean(Y) - theta_one.mean(X)

2.2) For training set:
-Predict the difference of y_hat and y_test
-Calculate MSE value: mean(sum(y_hat - y_test)**2)

This is all formula neeeded to learn about regression model no matter it is linear or nor (I will talk about this later). But I would like to share with you all - the beginners like me, that is non-linear regression model just a special case of linear regression model.
So it is very important to understand maths clearly to know how the model works. If I have time, I will build the function by pure python but maybe later. 
Lastly, sorry for writing the formula like that. I will try to learn how to write it in symbols in the next time. This is my very first note for my Github.
Thank you for reading, I am glad to receive some feedbacks from you all. Please do not hesitate to contact me via my email: tuyetnhictl135@gmail.com
